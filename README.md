Bash - vi Mode:

`set -o vi` in *.bashrc* to enable vi Mode.
`bind -P` to show all vi Mode shortcuts. Shows none set when in vi's Insert mode and all of them when in Normal mode.
Mostly the only thing different is that you can't do `i`, as in you can't use `diw` to delete in a word.


Vi(m) tips:

`cc` to delete whole line and go into Insert mode
`cw` to delete to the end of the current word and go into Insert mode
`.` to repeat last action
`B` to move back a word, not stopping for punctuation (symbols?)
`0` goes to beginning of the line instead of `^` going to the first word
`%` jump in between opening and closing parentheses, braces, and `/* */` style comments
